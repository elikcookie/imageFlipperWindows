# Image Flipping Script README

This script automates the process of flipping images horizontally using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It takes images from a specified folder, applies horizontal flipping, and saves the flipped images to a separate folder.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Python Imaging Library (PIL)

Install PIL using `pip install Pillow`.

## Usage

1. Place the images to be flipped in the 'toflip' folder.
2. Ensure that the 'flipped' folder exists in the specified directory or create it manually.
3. Run the script to flip the images and save them in the 'flipped' folder.
4. The script supports common image formats, such as PNG, JPEG, and JPG.

## Notes ! IMPORTANT !

- Make sure the **folder paths** are correctly specified in the code.
- The script will process all images with the supported formats in the 'toflip' folder.
- The flipped images will be saved with the same filenames in the 'flipped' folder.
